# Development of machine learning models for classification and analysis of Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in cancer

This repository includes source code and initial analysis results for applying machine learning approaches 
to classify and analyse ecDNA in cancer using a gold standard database CytoCellDB. 
It represents our initial effort to assess the application of CytoCellDB data in the 
classification and analysis of ecDNA using machine learning approaches. We are currently 
working on publishing our initial findings. In addition, we are actively enhancing 
CytoCellDB data and improving machine learning models.
